        <h2>Process Demonstration</h2>
        <p>This page details the process followed to build the project, including brainstorming sessions, development sprints, testing, and iterations.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Planning Phase: Outlining the Project Goals</li>
                <p> This project consisted of two sprints, where the first
                    sprint addressed user stories A-C and the second addressed
                    D-F. For initial organization, the team created a shared
                    Google Calendar, Trello board, and Discord server to
                    ensure that our communication remained timely and organized.
                </p>
                <p> At the beginning of each sprint, the team held a planning
                    meeting to discuss the user stories that would be addressed
                    in the sprint. We created a specific channel in the Discord to
                    provide each other with daily updates, and used the Trello to 
                    tag/delegate work and keep each other up to date.
                </p>
                <p> At the end of each sprint, the team held meetings to review 
                    and reflect on how we performed. At the end of the 1st sprint, we
                    decided that our communication needed to improve, so we created a 
                    voice channel in the Discord called "drop-in work" where we could all 
                    hang out and work together at any time, to avoid the pressure of overly-planned
                    work sessions. This greatly increased our productivity.
                </p>
            <li>Design Phase: Creating Mockups and Prototypes</li>
                <p> To begin, we used Figma to create a basic user flow 
                    and wireframes for the UI. We then created a basic brand
                    identity and applied it to the wireframes to create prototypes.
                </p>
                <img src="images/user-flow.png" alt="User Flow">
                <p> The basic decisions regarding the branding and setup were
                    made with the application's intentions and functionality in mind.
                    We wanted it to be clean and user-friendly, so we kept the colors 
                    and user flow simple to avoid overwhelming users. This also involved
                    using recognizable icons such as the filter button.

            <li>Development Phase: Building the Project</li>
            <p>This stage is where all of our pre-planning and delegation came in 
                handy. We initially struggled at first with the learning curve regarding
                Git and GitHub, but we quickly learned how to use it effectively. We used
                the framework of the Django tutorial to initialize our project.
            </p>
            <p>We broke up each user story into smaller, more manageable tasks and made
            sure to have other team members review our code before merging anything to the 
            repository. This gave members a chance to share any challenges they were
            facing and helped us stay up to date with our progress as well as the things our
            teammates were working on.</p>
            <li>Testing & Deployment: Ensuring Functionality</li>
            <p>We made sure to use Git and branches effectively to test our work before
                merging it into main to avoid any conflicts. The process of testing was 
                extensive and occurred throughout the creation of the project, rather
                than solely at the end.
